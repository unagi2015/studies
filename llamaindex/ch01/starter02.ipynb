      "Response: The writer’s childhood was marked by an early interest in both writing and programming. Initially, he focused on short stories, which he considered awful. At age 13 or 14, he used a school district’s IBM 1401 computer for programming, primarily using Fortran. He was puzzled by the machine and struggled to find productive uses for it. A memorable event was when one of his programs failed to terminate, causing concern for the data center manager. Later, he acquired a microcomputer kit from Heathkit, which greatly impressed him. Eventually, his father purchased a TRS-80, allowing him to write simple games, predict rocket trajectories, and create a word processor. He initially intended to study philosophy in college, believing it to be the study of ultimate truths, but found it boring and switched to AI after being influenced by a Heinlein novel and a PBS documentary.\n",
